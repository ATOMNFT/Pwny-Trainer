# Pwny-Trainer
This Arduino sketch turns an ESP32 into a dynamic Pwnagotchi trainer, generating random Wi-Fi networks, broadcasting beacon frames, and hopping channels to simulate real-world conditions. It helps Pwnagotchis learn to detect, deauthenticate, and capture handshakes, boosting their penetration testing skills.
